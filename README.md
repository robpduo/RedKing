# RedKing
## Summary Description

A Game similar to BlackJack, with slight alteration to the rules to win. As with traditional blackjack, users play against the dealer in a one-on-one, turn based scenario, to draw cards from the deck until the cumulative value on either side reaches 21 or over. The player may 'stand' to hold the value of their cards and pass the turn to the dealer. Which ever hand is closest to 21 wins.
